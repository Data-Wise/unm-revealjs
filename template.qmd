# Introduction to Experimental Design

## Overview

**Definition:**
Experimental design is the framework for planning experiments to investigate how controllable inputs (factors) influence outcomes (responses).

**Example:**
Testing different fertilizers to determine their effect on plant growth.

**Key Points:**

- Active manipulation of factors
- Control of unwanted variability
- Valid causal inferences

## Learning Objectives {.smaller-slide}

- **Identify and classify sources of variation** in an experiment.
- **Define treatment factors, factor levels, and experimental units.**
- **Explore blocking, nuisance factors, and strategies to manage them.**
- **Understand the principles of randomization** and its role in statistical inference.
- **Examine standard experimental designs** (CRD, RBD, Factorial, Latin Square, Split-Plot) and their appropriate applications.
- **Distinguish between fixed and random effects** in modeling.
- **Plan data collection, run pilot experiments, and determine sample sizes.**
- **Gain hands-on experience using R** for randomization, exploratory data analysis, and basic ANOVA.

# Advanced Teaching Strategies

## Flipped Classroom Approach

**Pre-Class Materials:**

- Video on the basics of experimental design.
- Reading: Chapter 3 from Dean (2017).

**In-Class Activities:**

- Group discussions on pre-class materials.
- Hands-on exercises using R for randomization and ANOVA.

## Problem-Based Learning (PBL)

**Scenario:**
A pharmaceutical company wants to determine the most effective dosage of a new drug. Students will design an experiment to test different dosage levels while controlling for patient variability.

**Task:**

- Define objectives.
- Identify sources of variation.
- Choose an appropriate experimental design.

## Case-Based Learning
**Task:**
Analyze actual clinical trial data to interpret treatment effects and variability.

**Focus:**
Understanding results in real-world contexts rather than solely on calculations.

# Steps in Planning an Experiment

## Define the Objectives of the Experiment

- **Clearly state the goals:** (e.g., comparing treatments, optimizing factors, studying interactions).
- **Specificity:** Formulate objectives as clear questions or hypotheses to guide the design.

**Example Objectives:**

- Compare the effectiveness of three fertilizers on plant growth.
- Optimize temperature and humidity settings for maximum yeast fermentation.

## Identify All Sources of Variation {.smaller}

1. **Treatment Factors and Their Levels**
   - **Definition:** Variables actively manipulated (e.g., temperature, dosage) with specific settings.
   - **Example:** Dosage levels: 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg.

2. **Experimental Units**
   - **Definition:** The smallest division of material receiving a treatment independently.
   - **Example:** Individual plants in a field trial.

3. **Blocking Factors, Noise Factors, and Covariates**
   - **Blocking:** Group similar units (e.g., day of testing) to control variability.
   - **Noise Factors:** Uncontrollable variability (e.g., weather conditions).
   - **Covariates:** Measurable properties (e.g., baseline performance) that can explain variation when included in the model.

## Choose a Rule for Assigning Experimental Units to Treatments

- **Select randomization techniques:**
  - **Completely Randomized Design (CRD)**
  - **Randomized Block Design (RBD)**
  - **Split-Plot Design**

## Specify the Measurements- Smaller Slide {.smaller-slide}

1. Measurements
   - **Precision:** Define the accuracy and units of measurement.
   - **Frequency:** Determine how often measurements are taken.
   - **Example:** Growth in cm, tensile strength in MPa.

2. Procedure
   - **Consistency:** Develop step-by-step instructions for data collection.
   - **Training:** Ensure all personnel are adequately trained to minimize errors.

3. Anticipated Difficulties
   - **Challenges:** Identify potential issues (e.g., equipment failure).
   - **Mitigation:** Develop strategies to address these challenges.

## Specify the Measurements- Small Slide {.small-slide}

1. Measurements
   - **Precision:** Define the accuracy and units of measurement.
   - **Frequency:** Determine how often measurements are taken.
   - **Example:** Growth in cm, tensile strength in MPa.

2. Procedure
   - **Consistency:** Develop step-by-step instructions for data collection.
   - **Training:** Ensure all personnel are adequately trained to minimize errors.

3. Anticipated Difficulties
   - **Challenges:** Identify potential issues (e.g., equipment failure).
   - **Mitigation:** Develop strategies to address these challenges.


## Run a Pilot Experiment

- Test feasibility
- Validate instruments
- Refine factor levels or treatment combinations

## Specify the Statistical Model

**Example for One-Way ANOVA:**
$$
Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_i + \varepsilon_{ij}
$$

where:

- $i$: Treatment index.
- $j$: Replication index.
- $Y_{ij}$: Observed response.
- $\mu$: Overall mean.
- $\tau_i$: Treatment effect.
- $\varepsilon_{ij}$: Random error term.

## Outline the Analysis

- **Plan descriptive and inferential methods:** (e.g., ANOVA, regression).
- **Include diagnostic checks:** Validate model assumptions (e.g., normality, homoscedasticity).

## Calculate Sample Size

- **Perform power analysis:** Based on variability estimates and desired precision.

## Review and Revise

- **Revisit and refine decisions:** Based on pilot results and practical constraints.



## R Example: Simple Random Assignment

```{r}
#| label: random-assignment-simple
#| echo: true

set.seed(123)
treatments <- rep(c("A", "B", "C"), each = 4)
assignments <- sample(treatments)
assignments
```


## Sample Table

| Treatment | Replicate | Response |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| A         | 1         | 12.3     |
| A         | 2         | 11.8     |
| A         | 3         | 12.1     |
| A         | 4         | 12.5     |
| B         | 1         | 13.2     |
| B         | 2         | 13.5     |
