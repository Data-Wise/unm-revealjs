## Example slide

### This is Heading 3

Here we have some text that may run over several lines of the slide frame,
depending on how long it is.

- This is a bullet point
- first item 
    - A sub item

### Lists
1. first item
2. second item
   1. sub item

# Section Slide 

## Additional theme classes {.small-slide}

### Special classes for emphasis

- `.alert` class for default emphasis, e.g. `[important note]{.alert}` ==> [important note]{.alert}.
- `.fg` class for custom color, e.g. [important note]{.fg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- `.bg` class for custom background, e.g. [important note]{.bg style="--col: #e64173"}.
- `.highlight` class for highlighting, e.g. [important note]{.highlight}.
- `.note` class for notes, e.g. [important note]{.note}.
- `.warning` class for warnings, e.g. [warning note]{.warning}.

### Cross-references

- `.button` class provides a Beamer-like button, e.g.
  - `[[Call-out Section]{.button}](#callout-sec)`
[[Call-out Section]{.button}](#callout-sec)

## Code blocks I

This is a regular code block in a slide:

```{r}
#| echo: true
# This is an R code block
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(100)
summary(lm(y ~ x))
``` 

## Code blocks II
This is a regular code block with the cell option, `output-location: column`:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: column
# This is an R code block
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 2*x + rnorm(100)
summary(lm(y ~ x))
``` 


## Code blocks II {.small-slide}

This is a code slide with the class `{.small-slide}`, which is useful for code-heavy slides.

```{r}
#| echo: true
N <- 12 # Number of experimental units, Step 1
# Define experimental units and treatments
experimental_units <- 1:N ## 10 experimental units
treatments <- c("A", "B", "C") ## 3 treatments, Step 2

# Repeat treatments to match the number of units. The code covers both balanced and unbalanced designs.
treatments <- rep(treatments, length.out = N)  ## Step 3

# For a balanced design, we can also use:
# treatments <- rep(treatments, each = N/length(treatments))

# Shuffle (randomize) treatments randomly to assign to units, Step 4
set.seed(123) ## For reproducibility
randomized_treatments <- sample(treatments)

# Create a data frame with randomized assignments
randomization_crd <- data.frame(Unit = experimental_units, Treatment = randomized_treatments)  ## Step 5
print(randomization_crd)
```

## A Long Slide

10. This is item 10
11. This is item 11
12. This is item 12
13. This is item 13
14. This is item 14

## A Long Slide {.small-slide}

Here is an example of a slide with a long list and a smaller attribute class `{.small-slide}`:

1. This is item 1
2. This is item 2
3. This is item 3
4. This is item 4
5. This is item 5
6. This is item 6
7. This is item 7
8. This is item 8
9. This is item 9
10. This is item 10
11. This is item 11
12. This is item 12
13. This is item 13
14. This is item 14

## A Long Slide {.tiny-slide}

Here is an example of a slide with a long list and a tiny attribute class `{.tiny-slide}`:

1. This is item 1
2. This is item 2
3. This is item 3
4. This is item 4
5. This is item 5
6. This is item 6
7. This is item 7
8. This is item 8
9. This is item 9
10. This is item 10
11. This is item 11
12. This is item 12
13. This is item 13
14. This is item 14
